## Tosun Paşa - React DnD Soundboard

This is a small fun project for familiarizing myself with [React DnD](https://react-dnd.github.io/react-dnd/) library. (Drag and drop library build for React currently not supporting touch events) 

### [Live Demo](http://tosun-pasha.surge.sh/)

You can create a playlist by dragging and dropping sound clips taken from cult turkish comedy movie [Tosun Paşa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tosun_Pa%C5%9Fa)(1976). Sound clips can also be preview and reordered, player-controls allow user to create a random playlist, toggle repeat and reset playlist. 

### TODOS:

- [ ] Add more sound clips
- [ ] Create a loading screen
- [ ] Make playlist sharable
